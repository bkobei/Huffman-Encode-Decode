Anything text you want to test out the huffman encode and decode. This was for a school project in data structures and algorithms. The main purpose of this assignment was to teach us how to implement a frequency distribution into our code to encode and decode. This will help us in understanding how to compress files and decompress them. Although the code is not complete, it is still a great exercise for learning how to implement huffman encode and decode.
